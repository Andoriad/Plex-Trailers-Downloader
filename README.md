# Plex Trailers Downloader
Downloads trailers for movies.
The script checks if a [MovieDir]/Trailers folder exists. If it doesn't, it creates the folder and uses youtube-dl to download the trailer into this folder. [MovieDir] is used as the search query in youtube, so should preferably be in a format like 'Title (year)'.

# Installation
Youtube-dl is required!

Place the trailers.sh file in your movies directory. Make sure it is executable, and run it.
